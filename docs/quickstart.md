# Quickstart

```bash
brew install youssofal/mtplx/mtplx

mtplx help
mtplx doctor --summary
mtplx pull Youssofal/Qwen3.6-27B-MTPLX-Optimized-Speed
mtplx inspect Youssofal/Qwen3.6-27B-MTPLX-Optimized-Speed --json
```

Homebrew is the recommended macOS path. Python-only installs can use PyPI:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U mtplx
```

The GitHub release wheel remains available for reproducible installs:

```bash
gh release download --repo youssofal/mtplx --pattern '*.whl'   # latest tagged release
python3 -m pip install ./mtplx-*-py3-none-any.whl
```

The commands above are no-MLX-safe except generation and serving. A missing MLX runtime should appear in `doctor` as an actionable dependency issue, not a traceback.

After the verified model is available:

```bash
mtplx start
mtplx start cli
mtplx start cli --no-mtp
mtplx quickstart --port 8000 --no-stats-footer
```

`--no-mtp` switches generation to target-only AR. For MTP-equipped models the
MTP runtime stays loaded, so terminal chat can use `/mtp off`, `/mtp on`, and
`/mtp status` without reloading. Native AR-only models such as
`mlx-community/Laguna-S-2.1-oQ4e` instead install an unloaded AR route at
construction because there is no MTP head to retain.

The Laguna download is pinned automatically. It needs about 64.13 GB of disk
space, and the runtime's admission gate requires ≈85.3 GiB of unified memory
(weights plus runtime headroom and a 16 GiB system reserve) — in practice a
96 GB Mac, with 128 GB comfortable. Its default
context and maximum response are 32,768 tokens. A larger explicit server
context is accepted only when it fits the active Metal resident-memory cap.

Use `mtplx doctor --deep --json` for exhaustive diagnostics and `mtplx doctor --bundle` to create a redacted support bundle.
