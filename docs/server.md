# Server

The server target is OpenAI-compatible local serving, with Anthropic
Messages compatibility available for coding harness smoke tests.

```bash
mtplx serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --no-stats-footer
```

Endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/completions`
- `POST /v1/messages`
- `GET /admin/sessions`
- `POST /admin/cache/clear`

Binding to a non-localhost host requires an API key:

```bash
mtplx serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --api-key "$MTPLX_API_KEY"
```

For Open WebUI, set the OpenAI-compatible base URL to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1
```

For Dockerized Open WebUI, the container must use the host gateway URL, not the host's loopback URL:

```bash
mtplx openwebui docker-command
```

That helper disables Open WebUI's Ollama probe and background task generations
so MTPLX only serves visible chat turns by default.

For Anthropic Messages-compatible clients, point the client base URL at the
bare server root — no `/v1` suffix:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The Anthropic SDK appends `/v1/messages` itself; a `/v1` base would request
`/v1/v1/messages`, which is not a registered route.

## Android Studio

Android Studio's external model provider should use the OpenAI-compatible URL
schema and the MTPLX `/v1` base URL:

```text
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8008/v1
URL schema: OpenAI-compatible
API key: leave blank for localhost unless MTPLX was started with --api-key
```

Refresh the model list after the server starts. MTPLX supports the OpenAI chat,
streaming, and tool-call request shape used by local coding clients; Gemini-only
proprietary behavior is outside that compatibility contract. To verify a local
setup, run:

```bash
mtplx doctor android-studio --port 8008
```

Since 2.5.3 the stats footer only appears on MTPLX-owned surfaces (the app
and the built-in browser chat); API clients such as Open WebUI, Claude Code,
and OpenCode never receive it, so no flag is needed for them.
`--no-stats-footer` still turns it off everywhere, and
`MTPLX_STATS_FOOTER_SCOPE=all` restores the pre-2.5.3 behavior. Metrics
remain available at `/metrics`.
